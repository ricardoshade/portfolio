# Ricado's Portfolio

This is my first portfolio. Changes will be made to it as more projects are done.

Only HTML and CSS were used to build this website. The style.css file contains properties and attributes working in conjunction with elements found on the HTML file. 

The layout is straightfoward; it is based on a top-to-bottom layout. Most elements are organized in column form, so it is very mobile friendly. It is responsive due to the media queries used for this website. 

Only the first project has a working link. The other ones have the <a> element, but no links were used. Links will be added as more projects are developed.

The main challenge faced during the development of this project were adding a background image representing each section assigned to each project being displayed under the "My Work" section of the page. Future improvements include adding a gradient and text overlay effect when hovering over each project image, as well as changing the background's color.

If repository is to be downloaded, a straightforward "git clone" is enough to run this program. All image assets and necessary files are included.
